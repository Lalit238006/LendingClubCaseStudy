## General Information
The consumer finance company 'X' which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile wheater to Approve or Reject the application. There are two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

By the given data which contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
